### Demo (90 seconds):
> "I'll analyze the React repository by Facebook. [paste URL, click analyze] In just a few seconds, we get a comprehensive score based on 6 dimensions: documentation, code quality, project structure, commit history, version control practices, and activity. [scroll through results] Notice we don't just give a number - we provide a detailed summary and a personalized roadmap with specific steps to improve."
